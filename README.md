# centipede
A surface-level emulation of the classic arcade game, Centipede, written in Game Maker: Studio 1.4

This was a project for USC Class ITP-280, Video Game Production, taught by Anthony Borquez.
The assignment was to recreate an arcade classic in Game Maker.

The Centipede trademark and the copyright of the sprites are owned by Atari, though this recreated implementation is by Aaron Ishibashi.
